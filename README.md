# About

This repo contains the source for `rooibos-cli` which is used by the  - [Rooibos unit testing framework](https://github.com/georgejecook/rooibos). Please go there for more info.

# RooibosC and rooibosPreprocessor

Please note, this project has been renamed from rooibos-preprocessor, and the command line tool formerly named `rooibosC`, is now called `rooibos-cli`

# Note about releases.

The releases page is deprecated because:

 - I reset the release number when I changed package name
 - The changelog and npm cover everything that was in there.
